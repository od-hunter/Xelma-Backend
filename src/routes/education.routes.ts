      "Market volatility refers to the rate at which the price of an asset increases or decreases over a given period. High volatility means prices can change dramatically in a short time, while low volatility indicates more stable prices. Understanding volatility is crucial for risk management and making informed trading decisions.",

Key strategies include: setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, diversifying your portfolio across different assets, never investing more than you can afford to lose, and using position sizing to control exposure. Remember, volatility can work both for and against you.",

      "Price oracles are specialized oracles that provide cryptocurrency and asset price data to blockchain applications. They aggregate price information from multiple exchanges and data sources to provide accurate, up-to-date pricing. Price oracles are essential for DeFi applications like lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and derivatives platforms that need reliable price feeds.",

Some oracles use multiple nodes to ensure data accuracy and prevent manipulation.",

      "Oracle security is critical because incorrect data can lead to significant financial losses. Common security measures include: using multiple independent data sources, implementing reputation systems for oracle providers, requiring economic stakes (bonding) from oracle operators, using cryptographic proofs, and implementing time-weighted average prices (TWAP) to reduce manipulation risk.",
